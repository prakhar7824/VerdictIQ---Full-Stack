📘 VerdictIQ – Legal Case Analysis System
VerdictIQ is a full-stack legal tech platform designed to make legal analysis faster, fairer, and more accessible, particularly for the Indian justice system. It leverages machine learning, NLP, and XAI techniques (like SHAP/LIME) to classify legal cases, predict case outcomes, summarize legal documents, and suggest legal strategies via an interactive web interface.

🚀 Key Features
⚖️ ML-based Legal Case Classification (e.g., civil, criminal, family, corporate)

📊 Outcome Prediction using court, city, year, and case description with visual probabilities

📚 Legal Strategy Advisor based on past precedent analysis

📄 Legal Document Summarization & Extraction via Hugging Face NLP models

🔍 Precedent Search & Comparison with filters for Indian jurisdictions

🌐 Multilingual Document Support for regional legal texts

🛡️ Fairness Monitoring (bias detection & explainability with SHAP/LIME)

🎯 For Students, Lawyers, Judges, and Citizens to democratize legal access

🛠️ Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

Node.js (v14+)

Python (v3.8+)

pip

Git

Recommended Specs:
Minimum 4GB RAM, and open ports: 3000, 8001, 8002.

🔧 Step-by-Step Setup Guide
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Setup Frontend (React)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd verdictiq
npm install
3. Setup Backend ML Services
⚠️ Repeat the below steps separately for both myModel-classification and myModel-Prediction

A. For Classification Model (Port 8002)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../myModel-classification
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
B. For Outcome Prediction Model (Port 8001)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../myModel-Prediction
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Running the Project (Development Mode)
1. Start Backend Services
Classification API (Port 8002)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd myModel-classification
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
Prediction API (Port 8001)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../myModel-Prediction
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
Verify Servers:

http://localhost:8001 → Outcome Prediction

http://localhost:8002 → Case Classification

2. Start Frontend (Port 3000)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../verdictiq
npm start
Visit the app: http://localhost:3000

📚 Backend Dependencies
Installed via pip install -r requirements.txt:

fastapi

uvicorn

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

joblib

transformers (for NLP)

shap, lime (for explainability)

others as needed

🚀 Build for Production
1. Build Frontend
bash
Copy
Edit
cd verdictiq
npm run build
2. Deploy Backend ML Services
Recommended:

Use Gunicorn or Uvicorn with ASGI

Set up Nginx or Apache as reverse proxy

Add SSL Certificates (Let's Encrypt)

Define secure .env variables for configs

Use PM2 or Docker for process management

🛡️ Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Port already in use	Kill the process or change the port
Model not loading	Ensure model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl exist
API not connecting	Ensure the backend servers are running
Frontend not displaying	Check browser console and verify backend connectivity

👥 Target Audience
🧑‍⚖️ Law Students & Researchers

🧑‍💼 Lawyers & Legal Analysts

🏛️ Judges & Court Assistants

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Citizens seeking fair legal insights

🧪 Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite

Backend: Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers

ML/NLP: BERT, SHAP, LIME, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression
